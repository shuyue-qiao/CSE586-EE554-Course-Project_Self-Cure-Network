# Self-Cure-Network
This is the replication of Self Cure Network from kaiwang960112 on GitHub. 
Here is the link to his work site: https://github.com/kaiwang960112/Self-Cure-Network.
We edited train.py, generate.py, and image_utils.py with a little bit to fit these codes with the dataset that we got from kaiwang960112. In this work, we only use RAF-DB to replicate his work.
About the dataset, here is the link of how to get Real-world Affective Faces Database(RAF-DB):http://www.whdeng.cn/RAF/model1.html#dataset
