# Self-Cure-Network
This is the replication of Self Cure Network from kaiwang960112 on GitHub. 
Here is the link to his work site: https://github.com/kaiwang960112/Self-Cure-Network.
And here is the link to their paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10392.pdf.
Abstract
We edited train.py, generate.py, and image_utils.py with a little bit to fit with the dataset that we got from kaiwang960112. In this work, we only use RAF-DB to replicate his work.
About the dataset, here is the link of how to get Real-world Affective Faces Database(RAF-DB):http://www.whdeng.cn/RAF/model1.html#dataset 
The imgs file gives the proposed method pipeline of SCN. The src file has the train.py which is used to do training by using the dataset and image_utils.py is used for data augmentation. The generate.py file is used to add noisees to the dataset
